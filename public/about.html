<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a 24-year-old female who is struggling to find a job after graduating college. With a BA in Philosophy, there are not a lot of options. I am learning Web Development because I have realized that having these skills will open up a lot of pathways for me to have a successful career. Not only am I finding the learning process enjoyable, I also never realized how much creativity goes into Web Development. I have always been interested in art, and I am excited to see how my artistic skills could help me in my pursuit of this career.

<p> At my previous job, I did office and computer work where creativity was not very necessary. One thing I did like about my job was having a task, big or small, and being able to work on it until complete. I like taking on different projects, and having the opportunity to have some flexibility in what I am doing. A lot of jobs involve doing the same thing everyday, and it can become boring over time. This is why I think Web Development would be a great career for me because even though  I may be doing the same job, I will be able to take on new and different projects which will motivate me to reach new levels.</p>
<p> To sum it all up, I am beginning to discover a passion for Web Development even though I am still only learning the basics. I am truly excited to see what I can do with these new skills, and to see what more amazing things I can do with coding when I learn even more of the intracacies.</p>
